# Guidelines for contributing to the Referencing discussion at the JSON Schema Org

## Issues

Please use issues to either discuss general principels or give feedback on specific proposals.

## Pull requests

Please use pull requests from a repository fork to submit new proposals.  PRs for minor fixes (spelling, formatting) are welcome at any time.  PRs for larger changes should be discussed in issues first.

During this intial phase, proposal authors can determine when to merge PRs against their proposals.  This will change once we settle on a proposal to take into the standardization process.
